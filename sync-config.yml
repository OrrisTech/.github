# BetaHuhn/repo-file-sync-action configuration
# This file defines which files from the sync/ directory are pushed to org repos.
#
# How it works:
#   1. Files in sync/ are the "source of truth" for org standards.
#   2. The sync-files.yml workflow runs on push to sync/, on a weekly schedule,
#      or via manual dispatch.
#   3. For each repo listed below, a PR is opened with any file changes.
#
# To add more repos:
#   - Add the repo name under the `repos:` key in "OrrisTech/repo-name" format.
#   - It's recommended to add repos in batches of 2-3 at a time and verify
#     the sync PRs look correct before adding more.
#   - Repos that aren't ready for all standards can be placed in a separate
#     group with a subset of files.

group:
  # ── Full standards sync ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # These repos receive all org standard files.
