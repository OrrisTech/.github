## Hey, we're Orris AI 👋

We're a B2B AI consulting firm that helps small and medium businesses integrate AI into
their daily operations. Think IBM or Accenture, but built for a 20-person logistics
company or a 5-person law firm — same methodology, fraction of the cost.

We don't just advise. We build, deploy, and operate the AI tools we recommend. Our team
ships AI products daily, and every solution we deliver is backed by our proprietary
suite of 7 products:

| Product | What It Does |
