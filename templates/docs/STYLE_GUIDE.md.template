## 1. Brand Voice

### Tone Attributes

- **Clear**: Say what you mean directly. Avoid jargon unless writing for a technical audience.
- **Confident**: State things plainly. Avoid hedging ("we think", "maybe", "sort of").
- **Concise**: Shorter is better. Cut filler words. One idea per sentence.
- **Human**: Write like a knowledgeable person talking to another person. Not a press release.

### Voice Examples

| Instead of                              | Write                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "We are pleased to announce..."         | "New: ..."                         |
| "Utilize"                               | "Use"                              |
| "In order to"                           | "To"                               |
| "At this point in time"                 | "Now"                              |
| "It should be noted that"              | (Just state the thing)             |

## 2. Terminology Dictionary

- Use commas in numbers >= 1,000
- Use "%" not "percent" in UI; spell out in prose

### Dates and Times

- Format: "February 20, 2026" in prose, "2026-02-20" in code/data
- Times: "3:00 PM EST" (12-hour with timezone)
- Relative time in UI: "2 hours ago", "Yesterday"

### Lists

- Use bullet points for unordered lists, numbered lists for sequential steps
- Start each item with a capital letter
- No periods at the end of list items unless they are complete sentences
- Keep list items parallel in structure

### Code in Documentation

- Use backticks for inline code: `componentName`
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags for multi-line code
- Include a brief comment if the code is not self-explanatory
