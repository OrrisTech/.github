## 1. Design Principles

<!-- Core beliefs that guide every design decision. Keep to 3-5 principles. -->

1. **Clarity over cleverness** - Every element should have a clear purpose. Remove anything that does not serve the user.
2. **Consistency builds trust** - Patterns, spacing, and interactions should feel predictable across the product.
3. **Performance is a feature** - Fast interfaces respect the user's time. Never sacrifice speed for decoration.
4. **Accessible by default** - Design for the widest range of users from the start, not as an afterthought.

## 2. Color Palette

### Brand Colors

| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| Primary    |            |           | CTAs, links          |

## 3. Typography

| Role        | Font Family | Weight | Size    | Line Height | Usage              |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Heading 1   |             |        |         |             | Page titles        |
| Heading 2   |             |        |         |             | Section headers    |
| Heading 3   |             |        |         |             | Subsections        |
| Body        |             |        |         |             | Paragraphs         |
| Small       |             |        |         |             | Captions, labels   |
| Mono        |             |        |         |             | Code, data         |

### Font Loading Strategy

- <!-- e.g., Self-hosted with next/font, preload critical weights -->

## 4. Spacing System

Use a consistent spacing scale based on multiples of 4px.

| Token | Value | Common Use                    |
| ----- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| xs    | 4px   | Tight gaps, icon padding      |
| sm    | 8px   | Inline spacing, small gaps    |
| md    | 16px  | Default component padding     |
| lg    | 24px  | Section gaps, card padding    |
| xl    | 32px  | Page section spacing          |
| 2xl   | 48px  | Major section breaks          |
| 3xl   | 64px  | Hero sections, page margins   |

## 5. Component Guidelines

### Buttons

- Primary: Solid fill, used for the main action on a page (one per view)
- Secondary: Outline or ghost style, for supporting actions
- Destructive: Red-tinted, always requires confirmation for irreversible actions
- Disabled: Reduced opacity, never remove from the DOM (preserve layout)

### Forms

- Labels above inputs, not as placeholders
- Inline validation on blur, not on every keystroke
- Error messages below the field with a descriptive message
- Required fields indicated with a visual marker

### Cards

- Consistent border radius and shadow depth
- Clear visual hierarchy: title, description, actions
- Interactive cards should have hover/focus states

## 6. Animation Guidelines

Inspired by Emil Kowalski's animation principles:

- **Purpose**: Every animation should serve a purpose - guide attention, show relationships, or provide feedback. Never animate for decoration alone.
- **Duration**: Keep animations fast. 150-300ms for micro-interactions, 300-500ms for layout transitions. Anything over 500ms feels sluggish.
- **Easing**: Use ease-out for enter animations (elements arriving), ease-in for exit animations (elements leaving), ease-in-out for transitions between states.
- **Spring physics**: Prefer spring-based animations for natural movement. Small overshoot is acceptable; large bounce is not.
- **Reduced motion**: Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Replace motion with instant state changes or opacity fades.
- **Stagger**: When animating lists, stagger by 30-50ms per item. Cap total stagger duration at ~300ms.
- **Layout shifts**: Never cause layout shifts with animations. Use `transform` and `opacity` exclusively for performant animations.

## 7. Accessibility Standards

- **Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Color contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Focus indicators**: Visible focus ring on all interactive elements (never `outline: none` without replacement)
- **Keyboard navigation**: All functionality reachable via keyboard
- **Screen readers**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels where needed, meaningful alt text
- **Touch targets**: Minimum 44x44px for touch devices
- **Skip links**: "Skip to main content" link at the top of every page

## 8. Mobile-First Approach

- Design for the smallest viewport first, then enhance for larger screens
- Breakpoints: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px), 2xl (1536px)
- Touch interactions take priority over hover states
- Bottom-anchored navigation and CTAs for thumb reachability
- Content hierarchy should work in a single column

## 9. Dark Mode Strategy

- **Approach**: System preference by default, with user toggle that persists
- **Implementation**: CSS custom properties or Tailwind `dark:` variants
- **Do not**: Simply invert colors. Dark mode requires its own considered palette.
- **Shadows**: Reduce or remove shadows in dark mode; use subtle borders or elevation via background color
- **Images**: Provide dark mode variants where needed, or use subtle background blending
- **Testing**: Test all states (hover, focus, active, disabled, error) in both modes
