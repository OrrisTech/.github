- **Auth**: <!-- NextAuth / Clerk / Supabase Auth / etc. -->
- **Deployment**: Vercel (team: Orris, `--scope orris`)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)

## Architecture Decisions

<!-- Document key architectural choices and the reasoning behind them -->

- **State management**: <!-- Why you chose X over Y -->
- **Data fetching**: <!-- Server components, React Query, SWR, etc. -->
- **Routing**: <!-- App Router conventions, dynamic routes -->
- **API design**: <!-- REST, tRPC, Server Actions -->

## Code Conventions

- All comments in English, detailed enough for newcomers to understand
- Prefer mature open-source solutions over custom implementations
- Components are split logically and placed in appropriate directories
- Named exports for components, default exports only for pages
- Use `@/` path alias for imports from `src/`
- Colocate tests next to source files or in `tests/unit/` with matching paths

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests**: Vitest with React Testing Library for components and utility functions
- **E2E tests**: Playwright for critical user flows
- **Coverage thresholds**: 80% statements, 75% branches, 80% functions, 80% lines
- All code changes require corresponding unit tests
- Tests must pass before merging

## Environment Variables

<!-- List required environment variables (DO NOT include actual values) -->

```bash
# .env.local
DATABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Vercel
- **Team**: Orris (`--scope orris`)
- **Production branch**: `main`
- **Preview deployments**: Enabled for all PRs
- **Environment variables**: Configured in Vercel dashboard

## Performance

- Performance optimizations must include benchmark data
- Database operations must account for concurrency safety
- Target Lighthouse scores: Performance >= 70, Accessibility >= 90, Best Practices >= 85, SEO >= 90
